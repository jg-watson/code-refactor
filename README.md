# Code-Refactor Challenge

These files contain refactored code on existing html and css files.

## Operations

Existing code was condensed and elements were adjusted to better fit the desired results.

Code that did not function was debugged as best as possible.

Multiple commits were pushed to a git hub repository with noted updates. 

Included is a screenshot of the webpage:
